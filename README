This is a jQuery plugin.
In fact it is the only plugin you will ever need!(TM)
This can be used both by developers and site owners.
Aside from installing it requires no other technical skills. If you can have thoughts (such as "I have to go tot he bathroom...") you can use this.

The plugin adds an open, flexible and adaptive API to any web page by adding telepathy support to it.
You can transmit your thoughts, regarding how a certain area of a site should function, to it.
That is all.
You can also improve on it's mind reading algorithms as you wish, the code is pretty self explanatory.
